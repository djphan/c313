<pre>		Experiments with Flooding Algorithms
		------------------------------------

Suggested Activity
==================

1. Getting Started
==================
- Make a copy of the "flooding" directory into a new "lab3" directory
  (we are going to make some changes to the files!)

- Read the "1st.README", "2nd.README", and the block comment at the top of
  each "flooding*.c" program to know the main features of the programs.

- Note that all three programs implement a (partial) stop-and-wait
  protocol that works as follows:
	After a source node "S" sends an application message to a
	destination "D", node "S" disables its own application layer
	from generating a new message to "D" until an ACK with a
	correct sequence number is received from "D".
  The protocol, however, does not perform retransmissions.

  (So, what purpose does this protocol serve? This aspect is examined further
   in the assignment.)

2. Exploring the Supplied Scripts
=================================
- Execute "sh getfloodstats" then "gnuplot plotfloodstats.gp" to get
  an "efficiency-versus-time" graph of all three flooding programs.

3. The "gnuplot" Script
=======================
- Note that you can use gnuplot to generate a graph in a number of formats
  (e.g., "gif", and also "fig" for editing using the "xfig" program).

- Example: Copy "plotfloodstats.gp" to "plotGIF.gp".
           Modify "plotGIF.gp" by adding:

	   set term gif
           set output "out.gif"
	   ...
	   ...		 
	   # comment out the next line:
           # pause -1

4. The "shell" Script
=====================
- Note that the command: "cnet -W -q -T -e ... " can also be invoked
  from a Makefile.

- Example: Modify the supplied Makefile by adding the following lines
	   (note the TAB before "cnet") and then execute "make test1"
	   and "make test2".

           DURATION=5m
           EVERY=30s
           TOPOLOGY= FLOODING2
	   MAP= AUSTRALIA.MAP

	   test1:  clean
		   cnet -W -q -T -e ${DURATION} -s -f ${EVERY} ${TOPOLOGY}

	   test2:  clean
		   cnet    -W -q -T -e ${DURATION} -s -f ${EVERY} \
                	   -C "flooding2.c dll_basic.c nl_table.c" ${MAP}
 

- Note that the input to the "cut d: -f 2" command has the form
	Efficiency (bytes AL) / (bytes PL)  : 4.16
	Efficiency (bytes AL) / (bytes PL)  : 5.57
	Efficiency (bytes AL) / (bytes PL)  : 5.89
	...
  and the "cut" program splits each line around the separator ":"
  and keeps only the second field. So, the corresponding output is:
	4.16
	5.57
	5.89
	...
  The "awk "{ printf(\"%d %s\n\", ++i * $EVERY, \$1); }"" command
  then processes each input line and produces a corresponding 
  output line, so we get:
        5   4.16
	10  5.57
	15  5.89
	...
  in the "result.flood2" file, for example.

- Copy "getfloodstats" to "getMD". Copy "plotfloodstats.gp" to "plotMD.gp"
  Modify "getMD" and "plotMD.gp" to print the "Messages delivered" 
  global statistic.


5. Generating Random Connected Networks
=======================================

- The supplied "AUSTRALIA.MAP" topology file has 8 hosts, and "WORLD.MAP"
  has 35 hosts. To generate a random connected network with NNODES
  (say, NNODES= 15), and store the result in file "N15", one may use:

	cnet -p -r 15 | grep -v nicaddr &gt; N15

  Note: "grep" is used to omit lines containing "nicaddr" strings.
        Unlike "lan" and "wlan" interfaces, cnet does not allow the user
	to specify a "wan" link interface address. cnet, however,
        generates such interface addresses when processing a topology file.

- If needed, edit the generated file "N15" to fix the "compile=" string


6. Exploring the Performance of "flooding3.c"
==============================================
- This part explores the performance of "flooding3.c" when
  * each pair of hosts are separated by at least one router, and
  * links lose frames.

- The required changes are:
  * Modify "flooding3.c" to handle routers by surrounding the declaration
    of the application ready handler by the following if-statement:
  
    if (nodeinfo.nodetype == NT_HOST) {
        CHECK(CNET_set_handler(EV_APPLICATIONREADY, down_to_network, 0));
        CNET_enable_application(ALLNODES);
    }

  * Modify "dll_basic.c" to use "CNET_write_physical" instead of
    "CNET_write_physical_reliable".

  * Include "wan-probframeloss = 1" (so, the link loss probability is
    "1 / pow(base=2, power= 1)") in the topology file.

  * Make a copy of a topology file, introduce a router between each pair
    of adjacent hosts. For example, the links between Melbourne and
    Adelaide, Sydney, and Hobart become

	host Melbourne  { x=366, y=324, link to M-A, link to M-S, link to M-H }
	router M-A      { wan to Adelaide }
	router M-S      { wan to Sydney }
	router M-H      { wan to Hobart }

- Run "flooding3.c" on both topology files for 5 or more minutes and
  record the following global statistics:
      * Efficiency
      * Messages delivered

- Explain the effect of adding routers on the recorded values.


7. More On Command Line Usage: Directing Node Output to Files
=============================================================
- This part suggests modifications to periodically store information computed
  by each node in a node specific file. This feature simplifies the development
  and debugging of protocols without relying on the debugging buttons supported by the GUI.

- The suggested modifications are:
  * Modify function "show_NL_table" in file "nl_table.c" to print the simulation time
    when the function is invoked. This is done by adding the "printf" line below:

    static EVENT_HANDLER(show_NL_table)
    {
        CNET_clear();
        printf("\n time (since last reboot)= %s usecs\n", CNET_format64(nodeinfo.time_in_usec));
        ...
        ...
    }

  * Modify function "reboot_NL_table" in file "nl_table.c" to make function "show_NL_table"
    a handler for event "EV_PERIODIC". This is done by adding the "CNET_set_handler" line
    below:

    void reboot_NL_table(void)
    {
        ...
        ...		
	CHECK(CNET_set_handler(EV_PERIODIC, show_NL_table, 0));
	...
	...
    }

 * Create a new directory, say "debug", to store the generated per-node files.

 * Run any of the three flooding programs, say "flooding3.c", using:
   
      cnet -W -q -T -e 300s -s -f 100s -o debug/%n FLOODING3

   This line raises the "EV_PERIODIC" event every 100 seconds which (by the above
   modification) causes the program to execute function "show_NL_table". The "-o" switch
   causes CNET to store the printed lines in a node-specific file in directory "debug".

   CNET substitutes the "%n" string with node names when creating new files in directory
   "debug". You may use the "%n" string as part of a filename string (e.g., "out.%n").
